This is an Software for simulating mass-spring-damper systems. You can play/pause the simulation by pressing 'P', and restart it by pressing 'R'.

In the menu on the left side, it is possible to create or delete components. To delete, click on the button with 'D' and click on the component you want to delete.
To create a new spring, click the 'K' button and select the 2 masses this spring will connect. The same things can be done with the damper, by pressing the 'B' button.
To create a mass, click the 'M' button and on the simulating screen, it will create a mass on the height you clicked. To change the parameters of the components, just click on it (when nothing is selected on the left menu) and write the new value of the parameter.
With the 'F' button, you can create forces that will be apllied on the massas. For this, with the 'F' button selected, press the mouse on a mass and drag it up to add a 1N force up, and drag it down to create in the opposite direction.
